Likert-type item statement respondents indicate level agreement scale, typically ranging “strongly disagree” “strongly agree.” example, might ask respondents rate agreement statement, “Social media positive impact society,” using scale 1 (strongly disagree) 5 (strongly agree). type question particularly useful measuring attitudes opinions provides clear, quantifiable way capture strength respondents’ feelings issue.Likert-type items advantageous offer simple standardized way measure complex attitudes, allowing easy comparison across respondents.
