<p>When writing a research report, it is essential to structure your work in a way that clearly communicates your studyâs purpose, methods, findings, and conclusions. Each section of the report plays a specific role in this process, guiding the reader through your research journey. This chapter will help you understand how to craft each part of your research report effectively.</p>
<div id="abstract" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="7.1.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1.1</span> Abstract<a href="writing-and-presenting-research.html#abstract" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The abstract is a concise summary of your entire research report, typically between 150-250 words. It should highlight the purpose of your study, the methods you used, the key findings, and the conclusions you drew. An abstract is often the first (and sometimes only) part of your report that others will read, so it must be clear and informative.</p>
<p>In teaching this section, you will start by reviewing well-written abstracts from published research. These examples will help you see the balance between brevity and completeness. Afterward, you will be asked to write an abstract based on a provided research report. This exercise will be followed by peer reviews, where you can learn from each otherâs strengths and identify areas for improvement. Common pitfalls to avoid include being too vague or overly detailed, both of which can detract from the abstractâs purpose of providing a clear snapshot of the study.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1.2</span> Introduction<a href="writing-and-presenting-research.html#introduction" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The introduction of your research report sets the context for your study. It explains the research problem, why it is significant, and what the study aims to achieve. A good introduction engages the reader by linking the research question to broader issues or debates in the field, setting the stage for the rest of the report.</p>
<p>To help you write an effective introduction, you will be shown examples from academic journals. These examples will demonstrate how introductions frame the research problem and justify the studyâs relevance. You will then draft an introduction for a hypothetical study, focusing on clearly stating the research question and objectives. The exercise will emphasize the importance of capturing the readerâs interest while providing enough background to understand the significance of your research.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1.3</span> Method Section<a href="writing-and-presenting-research.html#method-section" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The method section details how the research was conducted. It should include descriptions of the participants, materials used, procedures followed, and methods of data analysis. The goal of this section is to provide enough detail so that another researcher could replicate the study.</p>
<p>To guide you in writing this section, a template or checklist will be provided, ensuring that all necessary details are included. You will write a method section based on a described experiment or survey, and then review it in class for completeness and clarity. The discussion will focus on the importance of transparency in the method section, as it allows others to replicate your study, a key aspect of scientific rigor.</p>
