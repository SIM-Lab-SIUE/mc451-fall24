# Descriptive Analysis

Descriptive statistics are critical in understanding the general characteristics of a dataset. They summarize key aspects such as the average value, variability, and distribution of data points. For media and mass communication research, descriptive statistics help answer fundamental questions about viewer ratings, playtimes, episode counts, and even word frequencies in media content. This chapter introduces common descriptive statistics concepts, illustrates them with examples, and provides R code using user-friendly packages like `dplyr`, `skimr`, `psych`, and `DescTools`.

We will begin by loading the necessary libraries. This includes downloading and installing them if necessary.

```{r}
if (!require("data.table")) install.packages("data.table")
if (!require("dplyr")) install.packages("dplyr")
if (!require("skimr")) install.packages("skimr")
if (!require("psych")) install.packages("psych")
if (!require("DescTools")) install.packages("DescTools")
```

We will then load the relevant datasets:

```{r}
anime <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-04-23/tidy_anime.csv")
horror_movies <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-01/horror_movies.csv")
richmondway <- fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-09-26/richmondway.csv')
television <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-01-08/IMDb_Economist_tv_ratings.csv")
video_games <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-07-30/video_games.csv")
```

You can access the data descriptions for each of these data sets on their respective TidyTuesday page.

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean (Arithmetic Average) {.unnumbered}

The **mean** is the sum of all values divided by the number of values in a dataset. It is a widely used statistic that provides an "average" for the data. However, the mean is **sensitive to outliers**—extremely high or low values that can distort the result.

#### Why the Mean Is Important {.unnumbered}

The mean is especially useful for **interval** or **ratio data**, where the numbers represent measurable quantities. For example, in media research, the mean viewer rating of a TV show can offer insight into how audiences generally feel about it. Similarly, calculating the average playtime of video games helps researchers understand user engagement.

Let’s calculate the mean using the `dplyr` package. In the **horror_movies** dataset, the `vote_average` variable represents movie ratings:

```{r}
# Calculate the mean vote average
horror_movies %>%
  summarise(mean_vote_avg = mean(vote_average, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**
```
mean_vote_avg
3.335728
```

**Explanation:**

- **Mean**: The mean (or average) vote rating for horror movies in this dataset is approximately **3.34**. This value gives us a general idea of the overall audience rating for horror movies. It is the sum of all ratings divided by the total number of movies.

In this example, you will see the average rating across all horror movies in the dataset, which helps summarize audience sentiment.

We can also calculate the mean playtime for video games in the **video_games** dataset:

```{r}
# Calculate the mean playtime
video_games %>%
  summarise(mean_playtime = mean(average_playtime, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
mean_playtime
9.057274
```

**Explanation:**

- **Mean Playtime**: The average playtime for video games in this dataset is about **9.06 hours**. This provides insight into the typical amount of time players spend on a game.

This calculation helps identify the average time spent playing video games, which is crucial for understanding player behavior.

### Median {.unnumbered}

The **median** is the middle value in an ordered dataset. It divides the dataset into two halves and is a **robust** measure of central tendency, especially when dealing with outliers. The median is useful when you are dealing with **skewed distributions** where the mean may not be representative.

#### Why the Median Is Important {.unnumbered}

The median is often preferred when the dataset has extreme values. For example, if we’re analyzing the number of episodes in anime series, there are a few long-running shows that might inflate the mean, making it less representative of a typical series. The median offers a better "typical" value in such cases.

Let’s calculate the median using `dplyr`. In the **anime** dataset, the `episodes` variable represents the number of episodes in each series:

```{r}
# Calculate the median number of episodes
anime %>%
  summarise(median_episodes = median(episodes, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
median_episodes
12
```

**Explanation:**

- **Median**: The median number of episodes in the anime dataset is **12**. The median represents the middle value, meaning half of the anime series have fewer than 12 episodes, and the other half have more. The median is useful when data has extreme values (outliers) that could skew the mean.

In this example, we are calculating the middle value of the episode count, which offers a clear sense of how long a typical anime series runs without the influence of extreme values.

We can also calculate the median playtime for video games:

```{r}
# Calculate the median playtime
video_games %>%
  summarise(median_playtime = median(median_playtime, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
median_playtime
0
```

**Explanation:**

- **Median Playtime**: The median playtime is **0**. This result suggests that many games may not have much playtime recorded, or playtimes could be concentrated near zero. The median here indicates that at least half of the games have very little or no recorded playtime.

This helps understand the typical amount of time players engage with video games, unaffected by particularly short or long playtimes.

### Mode {.unnumbered}

The **mode** is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with **nominal** or **categorical data**, where the values don’t have a specific order.

#### Why the Mode Is Important {.unnumbered}

The mode is particularly useful for **categorical data** in media research. For example, if you want to find out which genre of horror movie is most common, the mode provides that information.

We will use the `DescTools` package to calculate the mode in a straightforward way. In the **horror_movies** dataset, the `genre_names` variable contains the genre of each movie. Here’s how to calculate the mode:

```{r}
# Calculate the mode of genre names
horror_movies %>%
  summarise(mode_genre = Mode(genre_names, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
mode_genre
Horror
```

**Explanation:**

- **Mode**: The mode represents the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. In this case, the most common genre in the horror movies dataset is "Horror," which makes sense since we are analyzing horror movies.

In this case, the most frequent genre will tell you what type of horror movie is most commonly produced.

For the **anime** dataset, you can calculate the mode for the `score` variable:

```{r}
# Calculate the mode of anime scores
anime %>%
  summarise(mode_score = Mode(score, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
mode_score
7.41
```

This provides insight into the most common rating that anime viewers give to the shows they watch.

### Comparing Mean, Median, and Mode {.unnumbered}

Each of these measures provides a different perspective on the data:

-   **Mean**: Useful when the data are normally distributed and without extreme outliers.
-   **Median**: Best used when the data have skewed distributions or contain outliers.
-   **Mode**: Ideal for nominal or categorical data where you want to know the most common value.

By choosing the right measure, you can better interpret mass communication data and provide clearer insights into media consumption and audience behavior.

## Measures of Dispersion

While measures of central tendency tell us about the "center" of the data, **measures of dispersion** provide insights into how spread out the data are. This section covers **range**, **variance**, **standard deviation**, and **interquartile range** (IQR).

### Range {.unnumbered}

The **range** is the simplest measure of dispersion, calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest values. While it’s easy to calculate, the range is sensitive to outliers.

#### Why the Range Is Important {.unnumbered}

The range gives a quick sense of the spread in the data. In media research, the range could show the difference between the highest and lowest user ratings or playtimes.

Here’s how to calculate the range for **anime** scores using `dplyr`:

```{r}
# Calculate the range of anime scores
anime %>%
  summarise(range_score = max(score, na.rm = TRUE) - min(score, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
range_score
9
```

**Explanation:**

- **Range**: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest score, which is **9**. This indicates that anime scores in this dataset range from a minimum score of **1** to a maximum score of **10**.

For **video games** playtime:

```{r}
# Calculate the range of playtime
video_games %>%
  summarise(range_playtime = max(average_playtime, na.rm = TRUE) - min(average_playtime, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
range_playtime
5670
```

**Explanation:**

- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum playtime is **5670 hours**, indicating a wide variation in playtimes. Some games have very high playtimes, while others have little or no recorded playtime.

### Variance {.unnumbered}

Variance measures how far data points are from the mean. It is calculated by averaging the squared deviations from the mean.

#### Why Variance Is Important {.unnumbered}

Variance gives a sense of the overall variability in the data. In media research, it helps understand whether viewer ratings are tightly clustered or widely spread.

Here’s how to calculate variance for horror movie ratings:

```{r}
# Calculate the variance of horror movie ratings
horror_movies %>%
  summarise(var_vote_avg = var(vote_average, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
var_vote_avg
8.271386
```

**Explanation:**

- **Variance**: The variance of the horror movie ratings is **8.27**. Variance measures how much the ratings spread out from the average. A higher variance means there’s a lot of variability in the ratings (some movies are rated very high, others very low).

### Standard Deviation {.unnumbered}

The **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance. It provides a more interpretable measure of variability since it is expressed in the same units as the data.

#### Why Standard Deviation Is Important {.unnumbered}

The standard deviation is widely used in media research because it shows how consistent or variable audience ratings or playtimes are.

Here’s how to calculate the standard deviation for **anime** scores:

```{r}
# Calculate the standard deviation of anime scores
anime %>%
  summarise(sd_score = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
sd_score
0.973677
```

**Explanation:**

- **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation is **0.97**, which tells us how much anime scores deviate from the mean score. A smaller standard deviation would indicate that most anime scores are close to the mean, while a larger standard deviation would show that scores are spread out.

Continuing from where we left off, let's elaborate on **Interquartile Range (IQR)** and why it’s particularly useful in descriptive analysis, followed by a broader summary of how students can interpret these measures of dispersion in mass communication and media research.

### Interquartile Range (IQR) {.unnumbered}

The **IQR** is calculated by subtracting the 25th percentile (Q1) from the 75th percentile (Q3) of the data. This measure focuses on the central spread of the data, providing a more robust understanding of variability, especially in the presence of outliers or skewed distributions.

#### Why IQR Is Important {.unnumbered}

The IQR is a great way to assess the **spread of typical values** in a dataset without being influenced by extreme values. In media research, the IQR could help determine typical viewership ranges for television shows or typical ratings for movies, excluding unusually high or low values that may distort the analysis.

Let’s calculate the IQR for **video games** playtime using `dplyr`:

```{r}
# Calculate the IQR for playtime in video games
video_games %>%
  summarise(IQR_playtime = IQR(average_playtime, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**Output:**

```
IQR_playtime
0
```

**Explanation:**

- **IQR (Interquartile Range)**: The IQR is **0**, which means that the middle 50% of the data (from the 25th to the 75th percentile) has the same value, indicating that most of the recorded playtimes are likely very small or close to zero.

This calculation focuses on the middle 50% of playtime values, which can reveal what the "typical" playtime for most users looks like, while ignoring extreme playtimes that might distort the analysis.

### Summary of Dispersion Measures {.unnumbered}

Measures of dispersion complement measures of central tendency by providing insights into how spread out or variable the data is. Here’s a breakdown of when to use each:

-   **Range**: Gives the simplest view of spread but is sensitive to outliers.
    -   Example: The range of anime ratings helps determine the difference between the highest and lowest user scores.
-   **Variance**: Quantifies overall variability by measuring how far each value is from the mean.
    -   Example: The variance in movie ratings reveals how much viewer opinion varies for different horror films.
-   **Standard Deviation**: A more interpretable measure of dispersion, expressed in the same units as the data. It shows how closely clustered values are around the mean.
    -   Example: The standard deviation of video game playtime helps understand how consistent or varied player engagement is.
-   **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Focuses on the middle 50% of the data, excluding outliers. It is useful for skewed datasets.
    -   Example: The IQR of horror movie ratings tells us the spread of typical viewer ratings, without being skewed by a few extremely high or low ratings.

Together, these measures of dispersion provide a more complete picture of the dataset, helping researchers to assess whether their data is tightly clustered or spread out, consistent or varied, and to what extent outliers are influencing the results.

## Using `skimr` for Quick Descriptive Analysis

The `skimr` package offers a quick and comprehensive summary of a dataset, including both central tendency and dispersion measures. It’s a great tool for providing students with an overview of their data before diving deeper into analysis.

### Convert the date columns to a proper date format

You can use `as.Date()` to ensure your date and time data are in the correct format.

```{r}
# Convert date columns to Date format
anime <- anime %>%
  mutate(start_date = as.Date(start_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"),
         end_date = as.Date(end_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))
```

This assumes the dates are in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. If they are in another format, adjust the `format` argument accordingly.

### Run `skim()` after fixing the dates

Once the dates are properly formatted, you can run `skim()` again to get a summary of the dataset:

```{r}
# Quick summary of the anime dataset
skim(anime)
```

**Output 1 (General Summary)**:
- **Name**: anime
- **Number of rows**: 77,911 (number of observations)
- **Number of columns**: 28 (number of variables)
- **Data types**: Most columns are character (17), with 8 numeric, 2 date, and 1 logical.

**Output 2 (Column Details)**:
- This part of the output provides detailed information about individual columns. For example:
  - **name**: No missing values, with 13,628 unique entries.
  - **episodes**: Has 987 missing values, median is 12 episodes, and the max is 3,057 episodes.

**Explanation**:
- **skim()** gives a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including missing values, column types, unique values, and basic statistics like min, max, and median. This helps you quickly understand the structure and quality of the data before analyzing it further.

This command will give you a detailed summary of each variable, including counts, missing values, mean, median, standard deviation, min/max values, and more. The `skimr` package is particularly useful because it provides a concise summary in an easy-to-read format, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis.

## Using the `psych` Package for Descriptive Statistics

The `psych` package also offers advanced functions for summary statistics, which are especially useful in media research. This package simplifies descriptive and inferential statistics and makes it easy to calculate multiple statistics at once.

Here’s how to calculate a wide range of descriptive statistics for the **horror_movies** dataset:

```{r}
# Summary statistics using psych
describe(horror_movies$vote_average)
```

**Output:**

```
vars  n      mean  sd   median  trimmed  mad  min  max  range  skew  kurtosis  se
X1    1   32540   3.34  2.88    4       3.17   3.71   0    10   10   0.13  -1.18  0.02
```

**Explanation**:
- **Mean (3.34)**: Average rating for horror movies.
- **Median (4)**: The middle value, showing that half the movies have a rating lower than 4, and half have a rating higher.
- **Standard Deviation (2.88)**: This shows there’s a wide range of ratings, as ratings deviate quite a bit from the average.
- **Range (10)**: Movies are rated between 0 and 10.
- **Skew (0.13)**: A slightly positive skew, meaning the data is somewhat skewed to the right (a few high ratings).
- **Kurtosis (-1.18)**: Negative kurtosis indicates the distribution is flatter than normal (fewer extreme values).

This command provides the mean, standard deviation, min/max values, and additional metrics like skewness and kurtosis, which can help you understand the shape and distribution of the data.

For the **video_games** dataset:

```{r}
# Summary statistics for video game playtime
describe(video_games$average_playtime)
```

**Output:**

```
vars  n      mean   sd    median trimmed   mad   min  max   range skew  kurtosis  se
X1    1    26679   9.06  117.94  0        0       0     5670  5670  27.03  948.55  0.72
```

**Explanation**:
- **Mean Playtime (9.06 hours)**: On average, people spend around 9 hours playing video games, though this average may not represent typical behavior because of the extreme variation in playtime.
- **Median Playtime (0 hours)**: This indicates that at least 50% of the video games have a playtime of zero, meaning many games in the dataset might not have much recorded playtime or are rarely played.
- **Standard Deviation (117.94 hours)**: This large value suggests that there is a significant variation in playtime among video games. While many games have little to no playtime, some have extremely high playtimes.
- **Range (5,670 hours)**: The difference between the longest and shortest playtimes is 5,670 hours, showing that a few games have very long playtimes.
- **Skewness (27.03)**: The highly positive skew indicates that most of the playtimes are clustered at the lower end (near zero), with a few extreme values pulling the distribution to the right.
- **Kurtosis (948.55)**: The extremely high kurtosis value suggests the distribution has heavy tails and outliers, meaning that a few games with very long playtimes are significantly influencing the distribution.
- **Standard Error (SE = 0.72)**: This represents the average error in the estimation of the mean. Given the large standard deviation and skew, the standard error is relatively low, but the distribution remains highly variable.

This command gives you a broad view of the central tendencies and variability in the dataset, helping you spot trends and outliers before performing more advanced analyses.

## Interpreting Descriptive Statistics in Media Research

### Putting It All Together {.unnumbered}

In mass communication research, descriptive statistics help answer fundamental questions about media content, viewer engagement, and user behavior. By calculating measures of central tendency and dispersion, students can gain valuable insights into how media is consumed, rated, and discussed.

For instance:

-   **Viewer Ratings**: Understanding the mean and standard deviation of movie ratings can help researchers identify whether certain films are polarizing or generally well-received.
-   **Playtime**: Analyzing the IQR of video game playtime can reveal the most common engagement patterns, highlighting whether most players engage briefly or deeply with the content.
-   **Media Content**: Finding the mode of genres or themes can help researchers pinpoint what type of content is most frequently produced and consumed.

Descriptive statistics form the backbone of media research, offering a clear, structured way to summarize complex data and make it interpretable. Whether you’re analyzing anime ratings, video game playtimes, or horror movie genres, these tools provide a foundation for deeper statistical analyses and meaningful insights.

### Summary and Learning Points for Beginners: {.unnumbered}

In these examples, you have explored various descriptive statistics for data sets related to horror movies, anime, and video games. Here's a recap of the key statistics covered:

- **Mean**: A measure of central tendency that provides the "average" value of the dataset.
- **Median**: The middle value of the data, useful when there are outliers or skewed data distributions.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value, particularly useful for categorical data.
- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values, showing how spread out the data is.
- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Measures of how much the data varies or deviates from the mean. The standard deviation is often preferred because it is in the same units as the data.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: A measure of the spread of the middle 50% of the data, used to understand variability without being influenced by extreme values.
- **Skewness and Kurtosis**: Skewness describes the symmetry of the data, while kurtosis indicates whether the data has heavy tails or outliers compared to a normal distribution.
