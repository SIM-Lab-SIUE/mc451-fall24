# Writing and Presenting Research

## Writing the Research Report

### Structure of a Research Report

When writing a research report, it is essential to structure your work in a way that clearly communicates your study's purpose, methods, findings, and conclusions. Each section of the report plays a specific role in this process, guiding the reader through your research journey. This chapter will help you understand how to craft each part of your research report effectively.

#### Abstract

The abstract is a concise summary of your entire research report, typically between 150-250 words. It should highlight the purpose of your study, the methods you used, the key findings, and the conclusions you drew. An abstract is often the first (and sometimes only) part of your report that others will read, so it must be clear and informative.

In teaching this section, you will start by reviewing well-written abstracts from published research. These examples will help you see the balance between brevity and completeness. Afterward, you will be asked to write an abstract based on a provided research report. This exercise will be followed by peer reviews, where you can learn from each other's strengths and identify areas for improvement. Common pitfalls to avoid include being too vague or overly detailed, both of which can detract from the abstract's purpose of providing a clear snapshot of the study.

#### Introduction

The introduction of your research report sets the context for your study. It explains the research problem, why it is significant, and what the study aims to achieve. A good introduction engages the reader by linking the research question to broader issues or debates in the field, setting the stage for the rest of the report.

To help you write an effective introduction, you will be shown examples from academic journals. These examples will demonstrate how introductions frame the research problem and justify the study’s relevance. You will then draft an introduction for a hypothetical study, focusing on clearly stating the research question and objectives. The exercise will emphasize the importance of capturing the reader's interest while providing enough background to understand the significance of your research.

#### Results Section

The results section presents the findings of your study. This section typically includes tables, graphs, and statistical analyses to summarize the data. The results should be presented clearly and without bias, allowing the data to speak for itself.

### APA Formatting and Citation

Mastering APA formatting and citation is crucial for producing a polished and professional research report. This section will guide you through the key elements of APA style, including the literature review, reference list, and appendix. Each component plays a vital role in ensuring that your work is well-organized, properly cited, and adheres to academic standards.

#### Literature Review

The literature review is a critical component of your research report, serving as a synthesis of existing research on your topic. It identifies gaps in the literature, situates your study within the broader academic context, and justifies the need for your research. A well-crafted literature review not only demonstrates your understanding of the field but also lays the groundwork for your research question.

To help you conduct and structure a literature review effectively, you will be provided with guidelines that emphasize the importance of critically evaluating and synthesizing sources. The goal is not merely to summarize existing studies but to connect them in a way that highlights their relevance to your research. As part of your learning, you will write a literature review on a given topic, focusing on identifying key themes, gaps in the literature, and the relevance of each source to your study. This exercise will be followed by discussions on how to organize the literature review logically, ensuring that it leads naturally to the formulation of your research question.

#### Appendix

The appendix is where you include supplementary materials that support your research but are not essential to the main text. These materials might include survey instruments, raw data, detailed tables, or consent forms. While not every research report will require an appendix, it can be a valuable addition when you need to provide additional context or transparency.

To help you understand what to include in an appendix, examples from published research will be shown. These examples will illustrate the types of materials that are typically included and how they add value to the report without overwhelming the reader. You will then be assigned to create an appendix for your research report, incorporating materials such as raw data, consent forms, or detailed descriptions of your methodology. The class will discuss how to reference the appendix in the main text, ensuring that it complements the report rather than detracts from it.

By mastering the elements of APA formatting and citation, you will be able to produce a research report that meets academic standards and clearly communicates your findings. Each section—the literature review, reference list, and appendix—plays a crucial role in supporting your research and enhancing its credibility. Through practice and feedback, you will develop the skills needed to apply APA style confidently in your academic work.

### Common Writing Challenges

Writing a clear, concise, and unbiased research report is essential for effectively communicating your findings to a wide audience. This section will address common writing challenges—clarity, conciseness, and avoiding bias—and provide strategies for overcoming them.

#### Clarity

Clarity in writing is about making your ideas easy to understand. This means avoiding jargon, using straightforward language, and structuring your sentences so that your meaning is immediately clear to the reader. When your writing is clear, you make your research accessible not only to experts in your field but also to a broader audience who may not be familiar with the technical details of your work.

To illustrate the impact of clarity on communication, you will be shown examples of both clear and unclear writing. These examples will demonstrate how unclear writing can obscure the meaning and lead to misunderstandings, while clear writing ensures that your message is conveyed effectively. Following this, a peer-review session will be conducted where you will critique each other’s writing for clarity. This exercise will involve providing constructive feedback on how to improve clarity, focusing on the use of simple language, short sentences, and active voice.

#### Conciseness

Conciseness involves expressing your ideas in as few words as necessary, without sacrificing meaning or important detail. In academic writing, being concise helps to keep your reader engaged and makes your arguments more persuasive. It also avoids overwhelming your audience with unnecessary information, allowing them to focus on the key points of your research.

You will explore the importance of conciseness in academic writing by examining examples of both verbose and concise writing. These examples will show how cutting unnecessary words and redundancy can strengthen your arguments and improve the overall flow of your writing. An exercise will be assigned where you will revise a passage to make it more concise. This activity will focus on eliminating filler words, redundant phrases, and irrelevant details, with a discussion to follow on how conciseness contributes to a more engaging and readable research report.
