## Multisensory Media and Audience Engagement

### Definition and Significance {.unnumbered}

Multisensory media, commonly referred to as "mulsemedia," represents a groundbreaking shift in how audiences consume and interact with content. Unlike traditional media, which relies on visual and auditory channels, mulsemedia engages additional senses, such as touch (haptics), smell (olfactory), and even taste. By tapping into the full sensory spectrum, mulsemedia transforms passive consumption into an interactive and emotionally resonant experience.

For example, virtual reality (VR) systems equipped with haptic feedback allow users to "feel" digital environments, such as the texture of a stone wall or the vibration of a virtual explosion. Similarly, olfactory interfaces in gaming or cinema can release scents that correspond to the on-screen action, such as the smell of ocean waves in a beach scene or burning rubber during a car chase. These innovations deepen user immersion, fostering stronger emotional connections and enhancing cognitive processing by engaging multiple sensory pathways.

The significance of mulsemedia extends beyond entertainment. It offers transformative potential in education, healthcare, marketing, and therapeutic interventions. For instance, interactive educational VR simulations that incorporate tactile and olfactory feedback can help students better understand historical events by recreating the sights, sounds, smells, and textures of the past. In therapeutic settings, multisensory environments are used to treat conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where sensory integration plays a crucial role in treatment.

### Applications in Media Research {.unnumbered}
